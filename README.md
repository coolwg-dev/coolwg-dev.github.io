# coolwg-dev.github.io

Placeholder GitHub Pages site for the `coolwg-dev` organization.

Quick start — preview locally:

1. Install a simple HTTP server (optional):
   - Python: `python -m http.server 8000` (works with Python 3.x)
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 8000`

2. From the repository root run one of the above commands and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Deploy:

- This repository is configured for GitHub Pages. Push to the `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages in repository settings if not already enabled.

Files added:

- `index.html` — the placeholder landing page
- `assets/styles.css` — simple styling
- `README.md` — this file

Next steps:

- Add organization content, navigation, and pages.
- Optionally add an automated CI/CD workflow to validate and deploy the site.
